    <p>This ABIS Portal aims to be a one-stop-shop for all matters relating to the understanding and use of <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis">ABIS</a></p>
    <p>ABIS is a standard and data can be formulated according to it and the standard provides tools (schemas, validators) to allow you to check that your data is formulated according to it correctly.</p>
    <p>This Portal also references all of the background objects that use of ABIS is dependent on, such as vocabularies for species observation methods.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This Portal is maintained by staff at the Department of Climate Change, the Environment, Energy & Water's <em>Biodiversity Data Repository</em> team. Please contact that team, via the Department, if you have any questions about this Portal.</p>

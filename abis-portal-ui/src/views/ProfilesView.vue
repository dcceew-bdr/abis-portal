    <h1 class="text-4xl pb-4">Profiles</h1>
    <p>Profiles of a Standard are constraints on its use. Profiles of ABIS are designed to guarantee certain forms of use. Profile sypically provide validators for their specific constraints.</p>
    <p>Known profiles of ABIS are listed in the <a href="https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/specification.html#_profiles">Profiles Section</a> of ABIS.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis/abis#profile-bdr">BDR Profile</a> sets the criteria for data to meet to be absorbed into the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/epbc/publications/biodiversity-data-repository">Biodiversity Data Repository</a> and mandates certain values for predicates, which particular vocabularies to use and so on.</p>
    <p>Further profiles of ABIS are able to be defined in the future.</p>
    <p>Users of ABIS can choose to conform to one, more, or no profiles.</p>
